# Introduction
## Classes
Where classes are presented and at KS4, convert to procedural code first

## Suggested Sequence
1. Constants
2. Data structures (lists, tuples, etc.)
3. Classes declarations - give class name but use 'pass after constructor
4. Function declarations - give function name but use 'pass until stub has been completed
5. The "game loop"
6. Function by Function build-out

# Extension Tasks
1. students to design then code+test scoring system
2. code+test new obstacles that are bitmap/icons
3. speed changes
4. design, code+test how to store contants, etc in a config file
